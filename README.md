# blog_MB24

This website is a blog where anyone can come in and post their ideas filling out a form

Within this blog, three main inputs represent a post; Username, Title, and Content.

When the submitt button is clicked with a missing field, the website prompts you to fill out that missing field.

Both webpages have a "dark-mode" option

Once a post is submitted, it remains on the page.
